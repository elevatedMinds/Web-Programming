# Choosi

[My Notes](notes.md)

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
> For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

With all of the fast foods options today it can sometimes be difficult to pinpoint exactly what you are craving for. With Choosi, that decision is less daunting and fun! Instead of wasting time debating on food options, Choosi's takes the highest rated fast food places in your area and complies them into a random generator that you can use to figure out where to eat. Make life easier and let Choosi decide for you!

### Design

### Key features

- Secure login
- On login location is retrieved and stored for customization of fast-food choices
- Random generator is activated on login and location authentication
- Ability to choose randomly selected option or try again
- Dynamically updated pie-chart and table of percentages used to display user's past choices
- A page dedicated to explain the purpose of generator and how it works

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Four different views: login, random fast food selection - play, user's most comman choices, purpose of application
- **CSS** - Cohesive and adaptive application styling, color scheme used to animate images for pages in place of current placeholder images
- **React** - Provides login, display random generator, display past options, backend endpoint calls. Faciliates movement between views/pages, and is reacive to user choices.
- **Service** - An [external API](https://www.abstractapi.com/api/ip-geolocation-api) is used to get user's location when they log in. Similary backend services with endpoints are needed to auntenticate users, and to retrieve and display selected choices.
- **DB/Login** - Stores user choices in database, which they can only view if logged in. Authenticate user login and store username and password in secure database.
- **WebSocket** - When user selects an option, pie-chart is updated reflecting all past selections and the amount of times they have selected an option in percentages.
