      <p>
        With all of the fast foods options today it can sometimes be difficult
        to pinpoint exactly what you are craving for. With Choosi, that decision
        is less daunting and fun! Instead of wasting time debating on food
        options, Choosi's takes the highest rated fast food places in your area
        and complies them into a random generator that you can use to figure out
        where to eat. Make life easier and let Choosi decide for you!
      </p>
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>
        Our generator takes some of the highest rated fast food places in your
        area and randomly selects an option for you. <br />You have the choice
        to spin the wheel again by clicking the "Let's try again" button or
        confirming your satisfaction with the selected option by clicking on the
        "Good Choice" button.<br />
        We aim to please, which is why we have the option to review someone of
        your past selected options on the home page.<br />
        Have fun and enjoy!
